# Features

- Init CM Request

- Approve CM Request

- Show CMs progress

- Trigger CM Cut Build Flow

# Basic Plan

1. get familiar w/ tutorial bot and general ideas, make it running

2. implement Init & Approve CM Request Part, with Authorization

3. implement Progress Tracking

4. implement CM Cut Build Flow with Jenkins Job

4 weeks without further test and modifications

2 days for regular hotfix CMs in a week -> 3 days to work on the bot

3 days per feature -> only 12 hours per feature
