## Thought

Prioritising == Urgent && Important

When you do stuff, how much time you allocate on it

task priority => Time Management

## Urgent || Important

Urgent: When to do it

Important: How long do I want to spend on it

U is fact, can be measured, same, can be escalated

I is up to you, personal.

- Box 1 UI: Crisis
- Box 2 U: Hassle, spend mininal time
- Box 3 I: Planning
- Box 4 !UI: Avoid, delegate

| | Important | Not Important |
| - | - | - |
| Urgent | Crisis, find root cause | Hassle, minimal time |
| Not Urgent | Planning ahead | Avoid/Delegate |

do more things in Box 3 => Important

## How to Get More Time

you have to do it, but just wanna get it done

plan them, spend minimum amount of time

If you didn't have to do it, will you miss it?

To Minimize tasks in Box 4:

- Reduce quality of completion
- Multitask
- Delegate someone to do it

## What is U/I to you

If you have more time, what would you do for life & work?

How can you add value to your time and work?

More time thinking and planning, developing myself, improving system, stop repeatings, investigating, how to motivate team better, vision for future, spend more time with family ... 

TODO list:
    Developing myself -> Reading, Workouts, Coding
    Spend more time with family
    Spend more time with friends -> Hang outs, Online Gaming
    Investigating

## Reduce the amount of crisis in your life

Problems: Stress and quality

Analyse root cause for Box 1 tasks

why did it becomes urgent and important crisis

keep asking why for the root cause to fix it

what can I do to avoid things becoming crisis

## Test for Unimportance

Box 4a: Have to do sooner or later -> plan ahead

Box 4b: don't need to do
